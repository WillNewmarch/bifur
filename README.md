Bifur is a JavaScript library providing accessible and understandable multi-threading functionality that doesnâ€™t complicate your codebase.

Bifur uses Web Workers at its heart, allowing it to provide true asynchronous functionality.

## Compatibility

Bifur is intended for browser use only and is compatible with all major browsers.

Check for specific browser compatibility here:
[https://caniuse.com/webworkers](https://caniuse.com/webworkers)

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install bifur.

```bash
npm install bifur
```

## Usage

Firstly, import bifur into your environment

```javascript
import Bifur from "bifur";
```

From here on you can call `Bifur.run` which accepts two arguments, a `Function` and an `Array` respectively.

```javascript
Bifur.run(
    (a,b) => {
        return a + b;
    },
    [2,3]
);
```

The function should be self-contained as it will be run in a completely separate thread to your current code.

The array of arguments should align with the parameters that your function expects.

The `run` method will then return a `Promise` that resolves when the function has finished its calculations.

```javascript
Bifur.run(
    (a,b) => {
        return a + b;
    },
    [2,3]
).then(result => {
    console.log(result); // 5
})
```

OR

```javascript
const result = await Bifur.run(
    (a,b) => {
        return a + b;
    },
    [2,3]
);
// result = 5
```

## Heavier Examples

The following functionality, if run in browser, will lock up the UI for several seconds while computing. Paste it into the browser console to see for yourself.

```javascript
let fibonacci = (num) => { if (num <= 1) return 1; return fibonacci(num - 1) + fibonacci(num - 2); }
console.time('fibonacci');
fibonacci(42);
console.timeEnd('fibonacci');
```

When running this with Bifur, the UI will continue running as usual while this calculation is made on a separate thread! Implemented like so...

```javascript
const result = await Bifur.run(

    (num) => {
        let fibonacci = (num) => {
            if (num <= 1) return 1;
            return fibonacci(num - 1) + fibonacci(num - 2);
        }
        return fibonacci(num);
    },

    [42]
    
);
 
```
_Note that pasting this into your browser will not work unless you import Bifur!_

## Why not just use Promises?

To quote an excellent answer from our beloved StackOverflow:

```
Deferred/Promises and Web Workers address different needs:

- Deferred/promise are constructs to assign a reference to a result not yet available, and to organize code that runs once the result becomes available or a failure is returned.

- Web Workers perform actual work asynchronously (using operating system threads not processes - so they are relatively light weight).

## Future Features
- Some sort of 'Register' function to persist a Worker, allowing for multiple uses of the same function without regenerating the worker, and allowing for the Worker to hold state if required.

## Future Improvements
- Test files could be TypeScript.
- Worker could be mocked in more detail.
- Tests could be run in a headless browser environment like Selenium.
